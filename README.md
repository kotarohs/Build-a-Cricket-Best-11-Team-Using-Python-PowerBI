## Summary
This project builds the best cricket team using Python and PowerBI. It scrapes player statistics from multiple sources, processes the data, and identifies the optimal team composition based on player performance metrics.

## Solution
The project involves scraping cricket player data, cleaning and preprocessing it, followed by feature engineering to calculate key performance metrics. A selection algorithm is used to determine the best performing players in various categories, such as batting, bowling, and fielding. PowerBI is then used to visualize the data and display the performance of each player in different scenarios.

## Approach
Data scraping is done using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to collect player statistics from cricket websites. Data cleaning includes handling missing values and standardizing formats. Feature engineering is applied to calculate key player metrics, and players are selected using a scoring algorithm. Finally, PowerBI is used for interactive visualization of player stats, and the optimal cricket team is selected based on performance data.
